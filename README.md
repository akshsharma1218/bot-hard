# About the project
* Mental health issues are generally undetected or are not recognised for an individual's entire lifetime. They accept their situations and don't even realise that there might be a better way of living life and feeling things. In India, with 10 percent of its 1.3 billion-strong population having suffered from one or more mental health problems.
According to WHO, India accounted for nearly 15 percent of the global mental, neurological and substance abuse disorder burden. A meta-analysis of community surveys estimates that the prevalence of depression and anxiety could be up to 33 per 1,000 persons. 
* Thus to diagnose this problem and help these people we have made a website that will interact with these people and determine their mental state.


# Approach to the solution
* We have trained a machine learning model that will ask you general questions about you and your daily life and based on your ans it will give a sentiment as a output. It can predict 5 sentiments Joy, Anger, Sadness, Fear, Neutral. We will take this survey for about 3 days to judge the mental state of the individual. We have created a website on which user can create an account and can answer these questions everyday, based on these answers we will plot a graph which will show the users sentiment. If the user is in a continuous state of sadness or anger that means the user is suffering from some mental illness. 

# Brief implementaion
* We will ask the user to register and provide a relatives phone number(In case of emergency).
* User will interact with the website and he will be asked general questions related to their daily life.
* Based on the user’s answer the website will predict an output for everything the user’s write. The output will be a sentiment in these 5{Anger, Joy, Sadness, Fear, Neutral}. 
* It will be a continuous judgement process as we can’t say that the user is in depression by judging him for a day.. We will judge the user for about 3-4 days and if the sentiment we are receiving is continuously anger or sad then we can say that the user is suffering from depression or any mental illness. At that very moment if we find that the case is extreme then we can notify the users relative.
* As we also have a diary section in our website, if the user has written a diary and it’s sentiment is joy then we will show the user his/her past happy thoughts.
* User will be provided with a graphical report on our website of different sentiments
